            My goal is to master the art of puzzles to more effectively help students (young and old) learn.
        </p>

        <p>
            Puzzles have long been recognized as one of the most intrinsically motivating activities. 
            Most puzzles (think jigsaw, Sudoko, etc) have no rewards and no badges, but people will 
            work on them for hours on end, enjoying the challenge and the progress they make.
        </p>

        <p>
            I believe that the intrinsic motivations inherent to puzzles can be a very powerful tool 
            in education. I believe that you can remove grades and tests and requirements and students 
            will engage with learning more than ever when that learning is presented in a form that:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Is highly accessible<br/>
                <small>It can be done at your own pace when ever and where ever you are.</small>
            </li>
            <li>
                Allows for autonomy<br/>
                <small>There are many paths leading to many 'correct' answers.</small>
            </li>
            <li>
                Requires pattern matching and creativity<br/>
                <small>Success requires more than memorization of facts or rote repetition.</small>
            </li>
            <li>
                Facilitates discovery<br/>
                <small>Occasionally you stumble in to a solution and it blows your mind :)</small>
            </li>
            <li>
                Encourages learning from failure and iterating on hypotheses<br/>
                <small>You aren't told what to do. You have to figure it out on your own.</small>
            </li>
            <li>
                Provides frequent intrinsic feedback, leading to a sense of progress<br/>
                <small>The puzzle itself provides immediate feedback about whether you are going in the right direction or not.</small>
            </li>
            <li>
                Has an obvious purpose<br/>
                <small>There must be some apparent end goal, even if that is simply solving the puzzle.</small>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p> 
            This is how I define the ideal puzzle.
        </p>

        <p>
            I don't see puzzles as just an app on your phone or a board game on the floor. I think the 
            best puzzles are when people try to explore and create. Building a product, writing a novel, 
            creating a piece of music, investigating history, and many more open ended activities represent 
            some of the best puzzles possible. These are the activities, in addition to more traditional 
            puzzles you might find as an app on your smart phone, that I hope to have students engaging in on a daily basis.
        </p>
        <p>
            At the end of the day most of what we do professionally is a puzzle. Artists, engineers, politicians, 
            entrepreneurs, musicians, lawyers, doctors, and thousands of other professions use the same skills 
            (creativity, pattern matching, developing strategies, learning from failure, iterating, etc) that are 
            used to solve puzzles. As we seek to give students the skills required to thrive in a rapidly changing 
            world, I think puzzles are a fantastic foundation.
        </p>
        <p>
            Some day I hope to open a brick and mortar "Puzzle School" where students can come together and work 
            together to solve puzzles, explore, build, write, create, etc. I think it will be a school that students 
            will truly enjoy and will leave with a love of learning and a desire to solve the great puzzles the world 
            has to offer (building companies, curing diseases, developing new forms of energy, exploring the unknown, 
            writing great novels, creating amazing art, etc, etc).
        </p>
        <p>
            For now, though, I'm focused on building and discovering the puzzles that will be the foundation for 
            The Puzzle School, and I'm going to make them available to as many people as I can.
            Check out the puzzles I'm working on in <a href='/labs'>the labs</a>.
