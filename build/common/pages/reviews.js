It's good practice for basic multiplication\n    and factors, providing feedback on whether the area filled in satisfies the number's requirement, but most of the\n    puzzles don't go above 9 and those that do don't seem to go above 16 or so, so you're not going to get in to\n    larger numbers at all.\n</p>\n<p>\n    If the puzzles involved a wider range of numbers then Shikaku would be a better tool for learning multiplication\n    and factors.

      explanation: "<p>\n    Lure of the Labrynth is a game with numerous math-based puzzles for teaching pre-algebra, tied\n    together by a comic-like storyline revolving around a lost pet.\n</p>\n<p>\n    The game has a very high production value. Clearly a lot of work went in to developing it. The story\n    line could work well, although I didn't really get caught up in it. The puzzles are well-done, but they\n    aren't quite granular enough, making them a bit too challenging.\n</p>\n<p>\n    It seems like a lot of work went in to the production of the game when I would have prefered\n    more work go in to the intuitiveness of the game and the puzzles.\n</p>\n<p>\n    Like any quality puzzle I would recommend giving them a shot with any student, especially since this\n    one is free and the production value is quite high. Unfortunately, I don't have a whole lot of confidence \n    that students will engage with this game enough unless they get caught up in the story, which could happen.\n</p>\n<p>\n    The puzzles themselves are, like most puzzles, an engaging way to practice pre-algebra concepts, such as\n    proportions, but they don't really make any attempt to teach the concepts, or at least the feedback\n    loops are not tight enough to facilitate learning for beginners. I think many beginners will give up before\n    being able to solve many of the puzzles unfortunately.\n</p>"

I'm\n    not entirely sure as there are feedback loops and mistakes are ok, but I get the sense that it was designed as\n    additional material for students to practice concepts they were already taught, rather than trying to teach\n    them the concepts through the puzzle.\n</p>\n<p>\n    If the puzzles were more granualar (starting very easy and gradually getting harder) and had tighter feedback loops\n    so that the learning process could happen more quickly, then I think the puzzles would be much more effective as\n    learning tools. As they are, though, I would worry that beginners would get frustrated too easily.\n</p>"

      explanation: "<p>\n    Mozilla Thimble is an effort by Mozilla.org (makers of the Firefox web browser) to make learning html more\n    accessible. It harkens back to the day when most people learned html by looking at the code other people\n    had written on websites by \"viewing the source\". In many ways the fact that you could view the source code for\n    web pages was instrumental in both the education of thousands of web developers as well as the explosion of the\n    web itself.\n</p>\n<p>\n    Mozilla has taken it one step further with Thimble, putting the source and the website side by side and making it\n    so that any change to the source immediately changes the website. This tight feedback loop is fantastic and makes it\n    easier to see the effect your changes have on the website. It's a great trial-and-error learning environment.\n</p>\n<p>\n    Unfortunately there's not much purpose provided by Thimble. They do try to create projects, but most have an excessive\n    amount of instructions buried in the comments. I think it's unlikely that a student who is just exploring will become\n    engaged by Thimble enough to get any real value out of it. It's certainly possible that a student will get in to it,\n    but I think it's unlikely.\n</p>\n<p>\n    So if you're coming to the table with your own motivation (e.g. you want to build a website), then I think Mozilla\n    Thimble is a great tool. With education, though, too often the problem is that there is a lack of purpose and the\n    educational activity needs to supply that purpose. In this case Mozilla Thimble falls short. I think it's unlikely\n    that a student will run with Mozilla Thimble without a lot of encouragement, support, and assistance. \n</p>"

Without bringing your own motivation to the table,\n    though, I don't think you're going to engage with Thimble enough to create a desire to learn more.\n</p>\n<p>\n    It's a tall order to get all of these aspects correct. Thimble does a very good job with the learning environment,\n    but I don't think too many students are going to engage with it unless they are forced to do so or they've been\n    inspired by some external factor.\n</p>"

      explanation: "<p>\n    Mozilla Thimble does offer some fantastic advancements in intuitive web design. They've made it easy to\n    click on a website and see what code is responsible. This makes it easy to explore a website from the outside-in,\n    seeing what code creates which effects. This can be very enabling to a learner.\n</p>\n<p>\n    They've also made it so that when you change the html code the website immediately changes so you can see\n    the effect of your code changes. This tight feedback loop is very well done and makes it very easy to learn\n    with html through trial-and-error, something we're a big fan of.\n</p>\n<p>\n    Unfortunately the site relies heavily on instructions in the code to describe projects and create a sense\n    of purpose. This is a real detractor from it becoming a great educational resource. I just don't think you're \n    going to be able to expose this to a student and have them run with it.\n</p>\n<p>\n    So while the click-to-explore and trial-and-error environment with tight feedback make the experience of learning\n    html very intuitive, the instructions buried in code make the projects and any sense of purpose far less intuitive.\n</p>"

With the click-to-explore\n    and automatic-refreshing of the website every time you make a code change, the engage is even more likely to kick in\n    to gear.\n</p>\n<p>\n    But without a better mechanism to drive purpose (we recommend puzzles), it's not very likely that a student without\n    a specific project in mind will be able to get deep enough for the engagement to kick in."
