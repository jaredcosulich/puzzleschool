You have a few simple rules and you have to solve increasingly difficult\n    algebraic challenges. It may not sound engaging, but that's the engagement that we really believe in here\n    at The Puzzle School.\n</p>            "

      explanation: "<p>\n    DragonBox is a very practical app. Although they do a good job of disguising the arcane looking algebraic equations\n    until you're a little further in to the game, they never deviate from the general ideas required to solve equations.\n</p>\n<p>\n    There is very little that is artificial or unneccessary in DragonBox. It sticks to the content, presenting it in a \n    way that makes it feel like an engaging puzzle, and we appreciate it for that.\n</p>\n<p>\n    The only knock I have against it is that it fails to demonstrate how to actually use algebra in real life. It is\n    focused entirely on solving equations, which is certainly a useful skill, but you might walk away from DragonBox\n    with no idea of how to use the skill you just learned outside of the game. That's a shame, but not the end of the world.\n</p>\n<p>\n    Hopefully they'll build out some more advanced levels that start to use the equation solving skills in more practical\n    situations, but, even if they don't, the game does a good enough job of making the equation solving skill fun that it's\n    likely that a student will figure out how to apply the skill themself once the game is complete."

There's\n    also a more advanced program at the $5.95 price point, which is a little annoying, but still quite affordable.\n</p>"

It does however make learning a language feel like an enjoyable and engaging experience\n    rather than hard work.\n</p>\n<p>\n    I can't really say that a student will walk away from Language Scramble wanting to learn more about languages.

      explanation: "<p>\n    Although people seem to engage with Language Scramble right away and solve numerous puzzles with no encouragement\n    (the students we worked with used it for more than half an hour without any sign of boredom or distraction),\n    we generally are not seeing people come back time and time again to learn more.\n</p>\n<p>\n    This may be due, in part, to both the lack of levels (there are only 6 so far and only in Italian), and the lack of\n    accessibility. Even though the game is available on most smart phones through the web browser, it has not yet been finely\n    tuned to work on phones and is not available in any app store. So in order to come back you would need to type in the URL\n    and sign in to the site.\n</p>\n<p>\n    In the future we'll have more levels, more languages, and we'll be making it available in all app stores for easier\n    accessibility. Hopefully that will make it easier for people to reengage with the learning after the first experience.\n</p>\n<p>\n    For now, though, we're very happy to see people engaging with such a minimal app. There's no speed, no competition,\n    just the language learning content. The puzzle dynamics are solid and the feedback loops are tight with immediate\n    feedback each step of the way. We're a big fan of minimal apps that engage effectively without the use of a lot of\n    bells and whistles (badges, bright colors, exciting rewards, etc).\n</p>"

Ideally there would be images and spoken words as well, providing a more complete experience of\n    the foreign language.\n</p>\n<p>\n    Still there are very few bells and whistles distracting from the language learning, so the learning is effective and\n    very practical as is.\n<p>"

So while it works well on an iPad, it leaves a little\n    to be desired on a smart phone.
