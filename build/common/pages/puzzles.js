The level editor also allows students to create their own\n        puzzles, improving their mastery of fractions while creating puzzles as well as solving puzzles.\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        We wanted to add in a feature that would walk you through the solution to the puzzle if\n        you got stuck. We wanted to make the game more about learning then about solving the\n        puzzles, so we focused on creating more levels with the ability to get help on any level\n        that is too hard.\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        We wanted to be able to track students as they progress through levels so that we can\n        determine if a level is appropriately challenging and improve it if it is not. If you are\n        interested in using these tracking features (how long a student spends on a puzzle, how many\n        moves they make, whether they complete it or not), let us know.\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        We wanted to developer the program in html and javascript so that it could more easily\n        be ported to a native mobile application.\n    </li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n    Light It Up is still a work in progress, so beware that it may be buggy.\n</p>\n<p>\n    You can try creating your own levels with the \n    <a href='/puzzles/light_it_up/editor' target='_blank'>Level Editor</a>.\n    Just click on a block on the board to add pieces of your puzzle to the board.\n</p>"

    explanation: "<p>\n    Architect is not an educational puzzle. It can help develop spatial skills, which have been shown to\n    <a href='http://medicalxpress.com/news/2012-07-spatial-skills.html' target='_blank'>improve performance in STEM subjects</a>,\n    but does not approach any other educational material.\n</p>\n<p>\n    We built Architect to provide a fun starting point for anyone exploring learning through puzzles.\n    It is meant to be more fun than educational, but does provide an opportunity to work on spatial skills\n    and working memory that can be valuable when trying to solve more educational puzzles.\n</p>\n<p>\n    Architect was inspired by Tetris, but was changed to minimize the somewhat stressful aspect of increasingly\n    fast falling blocks, making the game more about arranging the pieces to complete the puzzle then about the speed\n    with which the pieces are dropping. Along these lines we also added in the pause feature and the ability to\n    reorganize any piece at any time.\n</p>\n<p>\n    Architect was also built for touchscreens, making the experience a little more tactile than the original Tetris.\n    You actually have to grab and move pieces in order to position them.\n</p>\n<p>\n    Again Architect is more for fun than our other educational puzzles. We do think there are some educational\n    benefits such as developing spatial skills, but we are not promoting it as an educational puzzle."
