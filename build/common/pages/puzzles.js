It harkens back to the day when most people learned html by looking at the code other people\n    had written on websites by \"viewing the source\". In many ways the fact that you could view the source code for\n    web pages was instrumental in both the education of thousands of web developers as well as the explosion of the\n    web itself.\n</p>\n<p>\n    Mozilla has taken it one step further with Thimble, putting the source and the website side by side and making it\n    so that any change to the source immediately changes the website. This tight feedback loop is fantastic and makes it\n    easier to see the effect your changes have on the website. It's a great trial-and-error learning environment.\n</p>\n<p>\n    Unfortunately there's not much purpose provided by Thimble. They do try to create projects, but most have an excessive\n    amount of instructions buried in the comments. I think it's unlikely that a student who is just exploring will become\n    engaged by Thimble enough to get any real value out of it.

      explanation: "<p>There's still a lot more work to be done to make Language Scramble as accessible as it needs to be.</p>\n<p>\n    Although it works well on a computer or through a web browser on an iPad or even the iPhone, it's not yet\n    available through any app stores, and the web browser experience requires you to sign in, making it more\n    difficult to access the app through your phone or iPad.\n</p>\n<p>\n    The experience is also not yet optimized for small screens. So while it works well on an iPad, it leaves a little\n    to be desired on a smart phone. It works, but the experience isn't all that great yet.\n</p>\n<p>We're hoping to improve all of this as soon as we can.</p>"

      explanation: "<p>\n    Peanutty! is an experiment in teaching people how to code.\n</p>\n<p>\n    People can solve physics-based puzzles sort of like Angry Birds, while watching their actions create code.\n</p>\n<p>\n    Once people realize that their actions are creating code they can start to tweak the code and see what happens.\n</p>\n<p>\n    Small tweaks lead to larger and larger tweaks until they are capable of designing their own Peanutty levels.\n</p>    \n<p>\n    Unfortunately Peanutty! is still a little too hard for most people to engage with for long enough to truly learn \n    how to code, but we think it has the potential to become a great puzzle-like environment for learning to program.\n</p>"

      explanation: "<p>\n    Unforunately Peanutty! is still a bit too complicated for most students to engage with it beyond the first few\n    challanges. We think it has the potential to be a great environment to learn programming, but it's not there yet.\n</p>\n<p>\n    At this point I think it's too likely that a student would get overwhelmed and frustrated trying to use Peanutty!\n    Some students may be able to figure it out and have a lot of fun with it, but too many may find it confusing, leading\n    to a general sense that they're not good at programming. That's exactly what we would like to avoid.\n</p>\n<br/><br/>"

      rating: 3,
      explanation: "<p>\n    Alhough Peanutty! has some fun techniques to make it intuitive with very little instruction (namely the ability to\n    interact with the environment without coding, but having those interactions produce code), but it's still not nearly\n    intuitive enough for prime time.\n</p>\n<p>\n    As with the \"love of learning\" aspect, we hope to improve the intuitiveness of Peanutty! in the near future.\n</p>\n<br/><br/>"

    practicality: {
      rating: 5,
      explanation: "<p>\n    This is the one area where Peanutty! currently rates very highly. In order to solve problems and create levels in\n    Peanutty! students write the same code that I use every day as a professional programmer. There's very little\n    between the studens and actual coding. Maybe there should be some more layers of simplification, but as it is\n    students get a very practical exposure to programming, how it looks, how to interact with it, etc.\n</p>\n<br/><br/><br/><br/>"

    accessibility: {
      rating: 2,
      explanation: "<p>\n    Peanutty! currently scores pretty low here. It only works on the Chrome browser and isn't accessible on smart phones\n    or tablets. Even worse, we're not sure that it's ever going to be accessible on those more mobile devices.\n</p>\n<p>\n    The problem is that programming requires a fair amount of typing and we're not really sure that it's going to\n    work well with a virtual keyboard. I certainly wouldn't want to program anything substantial on a virtual keyboard.\n</p>\n<p>\n    Not only that, but we're not sure how to make it all work on a smaller screen. We want to make sure the environment and\n    the code are both visible at all times so that it's easier to make and test changes. We might be able to squeeze it into a\n    tablet format, but I doubt it will ever fit on a smart phone's screen.\n</p>\n<br/>"

      explanation: "<p>Upside Down Academy isn't a puzzle in itself, but it can help turn any lesson in to a puzzle.</p>\n<p>\n    The act of creating something is the ultimate puzzle.
