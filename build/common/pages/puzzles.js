Along these lines we also added in the pause feature and the ability to\n    reorganize any piece at any time.\n</p>\n<p>\n    Architect was also built for touchscreens, making the experience a little more tactile than the original Tetris.\n    You actually have to grab and move pieces in order to position them.\n</p>\n<p>\n    Again Architect is more for fun than our other educational puzzles. We do think there are some educational\n    benefits such as developing spatial skills, but we are not promoting it as an educational puzzle."

It does however make learning a language feel like an enjoyable and engaging experience\n    rather than hard work.\n</p>\n<p>\n    I can't really say that a student will walk away from Language Scramble wanting to learn more about languages.

Even though the game is available on most smart phones through the web browser, it has not yet been finely\n    tuned to work on phones and is not available in any app store. So in order to come back you would need to type in the URL\n    and sign in to the site.\n</p>\n<p>\n    In the future we'll have more levels, more languages, and we'll be making it available in all app stores for easier\n    accessibility. Hopefully that will make it easier for people to reengage with the learning after the first experience.\n</p>\n<p>\n    For now, though, we're very happy to see people engaging with such a minimal app. There's no speed, no competition,\n    just the language learning content. The puzzle dynamics are solid and the feedback loops are tight with immediate\n    feedback each step of the way. We're a big fan of minimal apps that engage effectively without the use of a lot of\n    bells and whistles (badges, bright colors, exciting rewards, etc).\n</p>"
