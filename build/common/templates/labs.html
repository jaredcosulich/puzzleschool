            <p>Language Scramble is a simple puzzle meant to help people learn a new language (right now we just have Italian).</p>
            <p>
                You're presented with a foreign (in this case Italian) word and need to unscramble the letters to 
                form a correct translation in English.
            </p>
            <p>It's a very rudimentary puzzle, but far more engaging than flash cards.</p>
            <p>
                It's not ideal as it has a "correct" answer for each translation. 
                A better puzzle would recognize that there are a number of correct ways to translate each phrase.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the future we will add in images and sounds as well, so that you can try to translate images and spoken 
                words as well as written words.

                Peanutty! is an experiment in teaching people how to code.
            </p>
            <p>
                People can solve physics-based puzzles sort of like Angry Birds, while watching their actions create code.
            </p>
            <p>
                Once people realize that their actions are creating code they can start to tweak the code and see what happens.
            </p>
            <p>
                Small tweaks lead to larger and larger tweaks until they are capable of designing their own Peanutty levels.
            </p>    
            <p>
                Unfortunately Peanutty! is still a little too hard for most people to engage with for long enough to truly learn 
                how to code, but we think it has the potential to become a great puzzle-like environment for learning to program.

            <p>Upside Down Academy isn't a puzzle in itself, but it can help turn any lesson in to a puzzle.</p>
            <p>
                The act of creating something is the ultimate puzzle. Trying to teach someone what ever you have just learned 
                forces you to take look at your learning from the puzzle perspective, analyzing it to figure out the patterns
                that will allow you to teach it to someone else.
            </p>
            <p>Upside Down Academy provides a place for people to post the lessons they've created where others can see and benefit from them.</p>        
            <p>
                At the end of the day, unfortunately it is unlikely that a student would choose to create a lesson on Upside Down
                Academy unless they are required to do so, which goes against one of the main tenants of The Puzzle School.
