        <h2>About The Puzzle School</h2>
        <p>We are working to create a new K-12 school somewhere in the greater Boston area.</p>
        <p>
            The goal of The Puzzle school will be to provide students with a healthy educational environment where they 
            have control over their time and the direction of their learning. We will seek to inspire, provide advice, 
            and help them think through their projects and goals along the way.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Puzzle School will be an environment that looks at education through the framing of a puzzle:

                Students working to achieve meaningful goals of their own choosing within a hypothesis-driven, iterative environment with honest,
                high-quality feedback loops.

            The goal will be to inspire students toward projects of their choosing, assisting them along the way, helping them break down complex
            projects and seek out better feedback loops such that they can the progress they are making toward a goal that is meaningful to them.
