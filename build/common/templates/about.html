        <h2>About The Puzzle School</h2>
        <p>The goal of The Puzzle School is to foster a love of learning while educating students.</p> 
        <p>We think puzzles hold the key to this.</p>
        <p>
            Puzzles may sound trivial, but puzzles inherently require people to use the scientific method and
            pattern-match, two of the most important skills in life. They are also enjoyed around
            the world as a deeply intrinsically motivating activity.
        </p>
        <p>
            To solve puzzles you must create theories or hypotheses about what will work and then test those hypotheses, 
            learning from both successes and failures to form better hypotheses. 
            In order to develop hypotheses efficiently you need to look for patterns that will inform your hypotheses.
            These pattern-matching skills are at the heart of our ability to communicate, be creative, problem-solve, 
            empathize, and many other abilities that are enormously beneficial throughout life.

                Puzzles have also long been recognized as one of the most intrinsically motivating 
                activities. Most puzzles (think jigsaw Puzzles, crossword puzzles, Sudoku, etc) have no rewards and no badges, 
                but people will work on them for hours on end, enjoying the challenge and the progress they make.
            </p>
            <p>
                Creating environments and products that teach through puzzle-like situations can make learning an enjoyable experience
                where students often experience "Flow" as they take on harder and harder challenges. 
                From this perspective you can think of puzzles as hypothesis-driven learning with tight feedback loops and a clear goal.
            </p>        
            <p>
                We think you can create educational puzzles that teach subjects ranging
                from foreign languages to math to writing to programming to entrepreneurship. We've already begun building and 
                discovering a number of <a href='/puzzles'>great puzzles</a> that do just this.
            </p>
            <p>
                We don't see puzzles as just an app on your phone or a board game on the floor. We think the 
                best puzzles are when people try to explore and create. Building a product, writing a novel, 
                creating a piece of music, investigating history, and many more open ended activities represent 
                some of the best puzzles possible. These are the activities, in addition to more traditional 
                puzzles you might find as an app on your smart phone, that we hope to have students engaging in on a daily basis.
            </p>
            <p>
                Some day we hope to open a brick and mortar "Puzzle School" where students can come together and work 
                together to solve puzzles, explore, build, write, create, etc. We think it will be a school that students 
                will truly enjoy and will leave with a love of learning and a desire to solve the great puzzles the world 
                has to offer (building companies, curing diseases, developing new forms of energy, exploring the unknown, 
                writing great novels, creating amazing art, etc, etc).
            </p>
            <p>
                For now, though, we're focused on building and discovering the puzzles that will be the foundation for 
                The Puzzle School, and we're going to make them available to as many people as we can.

        <h2>About Me</h2>        
        <p>
            My name is Jared Cosulich. I have a daughter, Abby, who was born Oct. 16, 2011.
        </p>
        <p>
            I'm building The Puzzle School because I want her to come away from her education with
            a love of learning. I don't want her to leave school, like so many people do, thinking
            that learning is something we must force ourselves to do no matter how boring or painful it might be. 
        </p>
        <p>
            I personally didn't start to really enjoy the learning process until after I graduated from college.
            I realized that if I treated my learning like a puzzle and attempted to figure out
            the strategies that made it easier to learn and master, rather than just execute the instructions that
            the experts described, then I enjoyed the process more and spent more time learning.
        </p>
        <p><a class='more'>Read more...</a></p>
        <div class='hidden' style='display: none;'>
            <p>
                Eventually I realized that not only was I enjoying the process more, but, compared to other learning strategies,
                I was actually feeling energized rather than being exhausted by my efforts. No longer was learning about following
                instructions, memorization, or repetitive actions. Now it was about solving a puzzle, and solving a puzzle was much 
                more interesting.
            </p>
            <p>
                I also realized that the progress I made was much more engaging and motivating because I was exploring hypotheses I had developed
                on my own. Rather than having an instructor tell me how to do something and then try to repeat it, I was the one figuring
                out what to do. I found the process to be very rewarding. Nothing is more exciting than developing a hypothesis on your own
                and proving it to be accurate.
            </p>
            <p>
                Millions of people enjoy solving puzzles every day. Jigsaw puzzles have been around for more than 200 years, crossword 
                puzzles more than 100 years, and more recently puzzles like Tetris, Sudoku, and Angry Birds have captivated billions of people.
            </p>
            <p>
                My goal is to make learning feel more like these classic activities that we have enjoyed for centuries. I want learning to be 
                a process of discovery. I want to create environments that encourage students to figure out solutions 
                through pattern matching, creativity, iterating, and lots of missteps. To me puzzles are the embodiment of all of this and
                I think that's why we enjoy them so much. I would like to see all of education look and feel more like a puzzle.
