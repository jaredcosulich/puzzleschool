    <h4>What Is This?</h4>
    <p>
        Code Puzzles is designed to simulate the process that I, 
        as a professional programmer, go through on a daily basis.
    </p>
    <p>
        When I am building my own projects, such as 
        <a href='http://puzzleschool.com' target='_blank'>The Puzzle School</a>,
        I'm constantly presenting myself with small challenges and then figuring out how to solve them.
    </p>
    <p>
        I will usually Google around quite a bit, looking at other solutions to similar problems
        that people have written about on blogs and coding websites, looking for inspiration
        in how to solve my challenge. That's why so many of the hints in Code Puzzles ask you
        to Google a specific term and try to figure out how to solve the challenge.
