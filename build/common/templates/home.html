        <h2>For Those Who Crave Challenge</h2>
        <p>The Puzzle School is focused on encouraging a specific process:</p>
        <p><b><i>
            The process of figuring out (puzzling out) a challenge, of developing and testing hypotheses, 
            learning from failures and successes, iterating and persisting closer and closer toward a solution.
        </b></i></p>
        <p>
            Our educational puzzles are built to be fun and engaging purely because they present challenges 
            that you can figure out.
        </p>
        <p>
            There are no high scores, just a sense of accomplishment and progress as you figure out 
            increasingly complex challenges.
