        <p>The goal of The Puzzle School is to foster a love of learning while educating students.</p> 
        <p>We think puzzles hold the key to this.</p>
        <p>
            Puzzles may sound trivial, but puzzles inherently require people to use the scientific method and
            pattern-match, two of the most important skills in life. They are also enjoyed around
            the world as a deeply intrinsically motivating activity.
        </p>
        <p>
            To solve puzzles you must create theories or hypotheses about what will work and then test those hypotheses, 
            learning from both successes and failures to form better hypotheses. 
            In order to develop hypotheses efficiently you need to look for patterns that will inform your hypotheses.
            These pattern-matching skills are at the heart of our ability to communicate, be creative, problem-solve, 
            empathize, and many other abilities that are enormously beneficial throughout life.
        </p>    
        <p>
            Puzzles have also long been recognized as one of the most intrinsically motivating 
            activities. Most puzzles (think jigsaw Puzzles, crossword puzzles, Sudoku, etc) have no rewards and no badges, 
            but people will work on them for hours on end, enjoying the challenge and the progress they make.
        </p>
        <p>
            Creating environments and products that teach through puzzle-like situations can make learning an enjoyable experience
            where students often experience "Flow" as they take on harder and harder challenges. 
            From this perspective you can think of puzzles as hypothesis-driven learning with tight feedback loops and a clear goal.
        </p>        
        <p>
            We think you can create educational puzzles that teach subjects ranging
            from foreign languages to math to writing to programming to entrepreneurship. We've already begun building and 
            discovering a number of <a href='/puzzles'>great puzzles</a> that do just this.
        </p>
        <p>
            We don't see puzzles as just an app on your phone or a board game on the floor. We think the 
            best puzzles are when people try to explore and create. Building a product, writing a novel, 
            creating a piece of music, investigating history, and many more open ended activities represent 
            some of the best puzzles possible. These are the activities, in addition to more traditional 
            puzzles you might find as an app on your smart phone, that we hope to have students engaging in on a daily basis.
        </p>
        <p>
            Some day we hope to open a brick and mortar "Puzzle School" where students can come together and work 
            together to solve puzzles, explore, build, write, create, etc. We think it will be a school that students 
            will truly enjoy and will leave with a love of learning and a desire to solve the great puzzles the world 
            has to offer (building companies, curing diseases, developing new forms of energy, exploring the unknown, 
            writing great novels, creating amazing art, etc, etc).
        </p>
        <p>
            For now, though, we're focused on building and discovering the puzzles that will be the foundation for 
            The Puzzle School, and we're going to make them available to as many people as we can.
