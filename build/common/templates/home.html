        <h2>The Beginning Of A New School In The Boston Area</h2>
        <p>
            We're working to make The Puzzle School a physical reality. It will eventually be a K-12 school that focuses on providing students
            with a healthy educational environment where they have control over their time and the direction of their learning.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Puzzle School will be an environment that looks at education through the framing of a puzzle: 
            <quote style='display: block; margin: 12px; padding: 0 12px; border-left: 2px solid #D4D4D4;'>
                Students working to achieve meaningful goals of their own choosing within a hypothesis-driven, iterative environment with honest,
                high-quality feedback loops.
            </quote>
        </p>
        <p>
            The goal will be to inspire students toward projects of their choosing, assisting them along the way, helping them break down complex
            projects and seek out better feedback loops such that they can get a better sense of their progress toward a goal that is meaningful
            to them.            
        </p>

        <!-- <h2>Become A Lifelong Learner</h2>
        <p>We believe there are few things in life as satisfying and fulfilling as learning.</p>
        <p>
            We believe that learning becomes an engaging and exciting activity when it feels like 
            you're trying to solve a puzzle, piecing things together, searching for patterns, 
            developing and testing hypotheses, learning from failures and successes.
        </p>
        <p>Our educational puzzles are designed for all ages and span a wide range of subjects.</p>
        <p>Play at school, on your commute, during flights, in the evenings. You'll enjoy yourself and learn a great deal.</p>
        <p>We hope to some day create physical spaces or even a school designed to foster a love of learning.</p> -->

        <h2>The Labs</h2>
        <p>
            The following puzzles are reflective of the larger goal of The Puzzle School, but The Puzzle School will not be overly focused
            on technology and apps. The puzzle aspect of The Puzzle School will be reflected more in the way students are encouraged to approach
            learning, their projects, and their lives.
        </p>
        <p>
            That said, technology will play a significant role and the following puzzle apps do provide examples of the puzzle approach to learning.
            They are R&D only at this point.
