        <h2>Our Hypothesis</h2>
        <p>The Puzzle School is working to prove a specific hypothesis: <b>better feedback loops enable more effective learning.</b></p>
        <p class='examples'>
            Here are some real world examples of this hypothesis: 
            <a class='writer'>Writer</a>, 
            <a class='pilot'>Pilot</a>, 
            <a class='golfer'>Golfer</a>,
            <a class='programmer'>Programmer</a>,
            <a class='everyone'>Everyone Else</a>
        </p>
        <div class='writer example'>
            <b>Writer</b>
            <p>
                Imagine if as a writer you were able to write an article, blog post, or book, hit a button
                and immediately get feedback about how many people read your work, if they got bored and stopped
                reading it part of the way through, or loved it and recommended it to friends.
            </p>    
            <p>
                Now imagine you could use this button as often as you wanted and every time you would get immediate
                feedback. It would allow you to experiment with your writing, exploring different techniques and
                immediately testing your ideas to see if they work.
            </p>
            <p>
                Although this example is impossible, it does demonstrate the power of an effective feedback loop
                toward learning. Great feedback loops allow us to develop and test hypotheses quickly, learning
                from our successes and failures and iterating toward greater understanding.
            </p>

        <div class='pilot example'>
            <b>Pilot</b>
            <p>
                If you are learning how to fly a plane, nothing is more valuable than spending time in the plane.
                Doing so, however, is time-consuming, expensive, and potentially dangerous.
            </p>
            <p>
                With a flight simulator, though, you can learn much of what you need to know about flying in less
                time and without the cost or danger. This is why the military spends so much money developing
                high quality simulations that they can use for training. Nothing beats a high-quality simulation when
                it comes to learning.
            </p>
            <p>
                A high-quality simulation is nothing more than an environment that offers the same feedback loops as
                the real world. When you steer left the plane rolls to the left, providing you with immediate feedback about
                what that control did and how it affected the plane. These feedback loops allow you to explore the plane
                and get real feedback about what each control does during the flight. You can make mistakes and learn
                from them very quickly and without any danger.
            </p>
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class='golfer example'>
            <b>Golfer</b>
            <p>
                Golfing is well-known as an incredibly difficult sport to learn. People will try for years to
                improve their swing in order to hit the ball accurately.
            </p>
            <p>
                Despite these challenges, if you introduce a simple device, a club that will break on a hinge if
                your swing is not at the correct tempo, it can be very easy to dramatically improve your swing.
            </p>
            <p>
                All this club is providing is a high-quality feedback loop about your swing. With such a tool it
                becomes easy to explore different swing techniques to find which ones work most effectively. While
                such a tool won't guarantee you become a great golfer, it can aid greatly in the learning process.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class='programmer example'>
            <b>Programmer</b>
            <p>
                Whether you are learning to program or programming in a professional manner, feedback loops
                are essential to making progress. Techniques such as automated testing or simply the ability
                to quickly load and test your program allow software developers to quickly test their programming
                to see if it is working correctly.
            </p>
            <p>
                Thousands of people have taught themselves how to program simply because the web enabled an amazing
                feedback loop. You could write a little bit of code and reload your website to see the results of
                your code instantaneously. This quick and high-quality feedback loop was at the heart of how many 
                people learned to build websites.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class='everyone example'>
            <b>Everyone Else</b>
            <p>
                Almost any profession will benefit from tools that provide professionals with better feedback loops.
                They allow us to test our hypotheses more quickly and easily, learning from our successes and failures,
                and allowing us to develop more refined solutions.
            </p>
            <p>
                Just think about your own profession and how a high-quality, immediate feedback loop would allow you
                to develop your own knowledge and skills more effectively. This is what
                we are trying to introduce in to the learning process.
            </p>
        </div>
        <p>
            We believe puzzles (environments with high quality feedback loops and clear goals)
            can be very effective learning tools that students will enjoy using, staying motivated solely
            because they realize how much progress they are making in their learning.

            Although our overall goal is to help schools leverage puzzles in order to make 
            learning more fun, engaging, and rigorous, right now we're focused on building and discovering 
            puzzles that teach various subjects that can be made available to the public.

        <h2>Our Mission</h2>
        <p>
            The Puzzle School was started with the mission of creating educational environments that will inspire a greater love
            of learning. We strongly believe that learning is something people truly love to do when it is presented
            in a way that gives the learner a sense of progress toward their learning goals.
        </p>
        <p>
            We focus on puzzles as they provide one of the most effective ways of creating a learning environment
            that is interactive, giving students an immediate sense of progress as they try to "figure out" the material
            they are learning.
        </p>
        <p>
            The methods we use at The Puzzle School mimic the learning environments that children thrive in while 
            learning how to walk and talk. This model can best be summed up as hypothesis and error driven learning, 
            where students develop a hypothesis toward solving a problem and are able to test that hypothesis using feedback loops, 
            learning from a success or failure as they move closer to a solution.
        </p>
        <p>
            This model has been used successfully in thousands of schools around the world, most notably Montessori Schools.
            We simply want to highlight this method and make it so that all students have access to environments where 
            they can learn in this way. We believe this will encourage a love of learning in all students.
