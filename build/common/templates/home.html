        <p>The goal of The Puzzle School is to foster a love of learning while educating students. We think puzzles hold the key to this.</p>
        <p>
            Puzzles may sound trivial, but puzzles have long been recognized as one of the most intrinsically motivating 
            activities. Most puzzles (think jigsaw Puzzles, crossword puzzles, Sudoku, etc) have no rewards and no badges, 
            but people will work on them for hours on end, enjoying the challenge and the progress they make.
        </p>
        <p>
            We think you can create educational puzzles that leverage the engagement you feel when you're enjoying a great
            puzzle. We've already begun building and discovering a number of <a href='/puzzles'>great puzzles</a> that do just this.
        <p>
            We don't see puzzles as just an app on your phone or a board game on the floor. We think the 
            best puzzles are when people try to explore and create. Building a product, writing a novel, 
            creating a piece of music, investigating history, and many more open ended activities represent 
            some of the best puzzles possible. These are the activities, in addition to more traditional 
            puzzles you might find as an app on your smart phone, that we hope to have students engaging in on a daily basis.
        </p>
        <p>
            Some day we hope to open a brick and mortar "Puzzle School" where students can come together and work 
            together to solve puzzles, explore, build, write, create, etc. We think it will be a school that students 
            will truly enjoy and will leave with a love of learning and a desire to solve the great puzzles the world 
            has to offer (building companies, curing diseases, developing new forms of energy, exploring the unknown, 
            writing great novels, creating amazing art, etc, etc).
        </p>
        <p>
            For now, though, we're focused on building and discovering the puzzles that will be the foundation for 
            The Puzzle School, and we're going to make them available to as many people as we can.
