%h2 Pivotal Mentors "Learn To Code" Pilot Program

%div{style: 'text-align: left;'}

  %h3 The Goal
  %p
    Starting in August of 2016 we partnered up with
    = link_to('Pivotal Labs', 'https://pivotal.io/labs', target: '_blank')
    to run our first "Learn To Code" program we dubbed the "Pivotal Mentors Program".

  %p
    The goal for the program was simple. Can we make use of the Pivotal Labs office
    and coordinate some of the engineers at Pivotal Labs to help students in the Cambridge
    area learn how to code? We simply wanted to start by providing positive software development
    experiences for students in order to hopefully inspire some to continue learning more
    once the program was over and ensure that all students felt capable of coding if they
    ever did decide they wanted to pursue it later in life.


  %h3 The Approach
  %p
    Within this program we would focus on a number of ideas that we want to explore with The Puzzle School:
  %ul
    %li
      Testing out existing resources and asking students for feedback on them in order to find high quality
      resources that students can use to learn at their own pace.
    %li
      Running retrospectives at the end of each sessions to get feedback from students around what worked that
      week, what didn't work, and what they were concerned or confused about.
    %li
      Supporting students toward independent and small group explorations and projects they design themselves
      and will continue working on after the program has ended.

  %p
    The existing resources we decided to test included:
  %ul
    %li= link_to('Scratch', 'https://scratch.mit.edu/', target: '_blank')
    = "#{link_to('Codecademy', 'https://www.codecademy.com/', target: '_blank')}, ".html_safe
    = "#{link_to('Code Combat', 'https://codecombat.com/', target: '_blank')}, ".html_safe
    = "#{link_to('Project Euler', 'https://projecteuler.net/', target: '_blank')}, ".html_safe
    and a number of Javascript game tutorials
    = "(#{link_to('snake game', 'http://docs.railsbridge.org/javascript-snake-game/', target: '_blank')}, ".html_safe
    = "#{link_to('breakout game', 'http://breakout.enclavegames.com/', target: '_blank')}, ".html_safe
    = "#{link_to('phaser.io game', 'http://phaser.io/tutorials/making-your-first-phaser-game', target: '_blank')}).".html_safe

  %h3 The Results
  %p
    For most students
    = link_to('Codecademy', 'https://www.codecademy.com/', target: '_blank')
    provided the greatest initial interest, but as the program progressed
    the javascript tutorials became a favorite before the students moved on again
    toward discrete challenges such as
    = link_to('Project Euler', 'https://projecteuler.net/', target: '_blank')
    and a series of decoding challenges we built for a scavenger hunt around the office.

  %p
    By the end of the program the clear feedback from students was that they preferred
    the discrete problems, especially the scavenger hunt which provided an opportunity
    to get up and move around and solve problems to discover the prizes.

  %p
    In general everyone seemed to really enjoy the program. Every student said they would
    come back to the next program if possible. While there's clearly room for improvement,
    the simple act of bringing students into an interesting non-school environment and
    having them work closely with experienced and empathetic mentors seemed to be a real
    success even as we experimented with the curriculum each week.

  %h3 Moving Forward
  %p
    We're already in the process of developing ideas for the next program. We have
    ideas for more discrete challenges, we're exploring a "Drawing In Code" pathway,
    and we're brainstorm around how to more effectively support students toward projects
    of their own creation.
  %p
    We're also going to try and bring in more mentors from other software companies in
    the Kendall area. We were able to bring in a few for this past program and it went
    really well so hopefully the program can grow into more of a club where mentors and
    students can connect around interesting software engineering activities on a regular basis.
