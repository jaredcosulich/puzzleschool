      We are currently designing and running programs in and around Cambridge.
    %p
      With each program we seek to work with the public school district,
      the after school community, or with a local business partner.

      We've partnered up with
      = link_to('Pivotal Labs', 'https://pivotal.io/labs', target: '_blank')
      to create an invention club hosted in Kendall Sq.
    %p
      The program focuses on supporting students toward creative problem solving
      through technical skills such as coding and engineering. We connect passionate
      mentors from the local technology community with students to help them
      explore and work together to solve interesting challenges.

    %p
      We meet with a small group of high school students on a weekly basis to
      discuss their educational experiences and what an ideal high school
      experience might look like.
    %p
      Topics range from the ideal class to how you can better support discussions
      of controversial topics to what the ideal schedule might look like
      to how you might deal with discipline in a school.

      We have been running a weekly program at the Moses Youth Center in
      Cambridge. The program has ranged from coding
      to more active engineering challenges.
    %p
      Many of the students at the youth center are interested in athletics
      so we're hoping to explore program designs that support that passion
      in the near future.

    %h5 The Art of Thinking
    %p
      Students will explore different frameworks for thinking (e.g. Design Thinking,
      Computational Thinking, First-Principle Thinking) and
      will develop their skills for observation through artistic exercises,
      philosophic discussions, and problem solving challenges.
    %p
      Students will use these skills to reframe challenges and goals in their
      own lives. They will practice observing from different perspectives,
      developing their ability to empathize more effectively, and question
      their own assumptions.
    %p
      Lastly we'll explore the way these processes and techniques have
      been used through-out history and continue to be used across all adult
      professional activities. Students will be supported toward becoming philosophers
      of their own lives and interests.

    %h5 Drawing In Code
    %p
      The Puzzle School is collaborating with David Ng, the founder of
      = "#{link_to('Vertical Learning Labs', 'http://www.verticallearning.org', target: '_blank')}, to develop an".html_safe
      = link_to('online resource', 'https://jaredcosulich.github.io/drawing_code/index.html', target: '_blank')
      designed to support an exploration of artistic observation and computational thinking.
      Essentially students will learn how to teach a computer to draw and design games.
    %p
      Through a series of challenges students will develop their ability to observe their physical world
      and translate that into code so that a computer can draw it. From there students
      will be able to animate their drawing and make them interactive (games).
    %p
      The eventual goal is to support students toward projects of their own design that can then
      be shared with friends and family.

      One of The Puzzle School's advisors, Ela Ben-Ur, is a 15 year veteran of the world-renowned design firm,
      = "#{link_to('Ideo', '', target: '_blank')}.".html_safe
      Drawing on her experiences at IDEO Ela has created the
      = "#{link_to('Innovator\'s Compass', 'http://innovatorscompass.org/', target: '_blank')}, ".html_safe
      a simplified
      framework for engaging in Design Thinking.
    %p
      We are working with Ela to design programs that leverage the Innovator's Compass and Design Thinking
      toward problems that are personally important to students. This may range from choosing a college to
      a fight with a significant other or family member. In each situation student will be asked to
      observe their situation, brainstorm on what matters most, think through possible future,
      think through experiments they could try to achieve their goal, and then repeat.

    %h5 Forge Your Unique Path
    %p
      We are exploring a series of questionaires and activities that can
      help students think about themselves more deeply. Students will explore
      their interests, their strengths, their weaknesses, and how they want
      to contribute to the world in a way that leverages their abilities and
      would add value to their community.
    %p
      Using this information students will brainstorm independent and group
      projects and will think about possible adult mentors who may be able
      to help them navigate toward their personal goals.
