      People sometimes mistake The Puzzle School for an online learning effort or
      for a school where the curriculum would be delivered online.
    %p
      In reality The Puzzle School seeks to be a physical school focused on a problem-solving
      process that can help foster a healthy community where students have
      greater ownership over their environment and education; where they have time
      to explore their interests and engage in a wide range of studies and projects.
    %p
      %b Technology will play a role in supporting this vision, but it is far from the only concern.
      High quality relationships between students, teachers, and parents,
      deeper exploration of student interests, and an iterative approach to learning are
      all more important than the technology listed below, but all can also be benefited
      by technology used in a thoughtful manner.

  .col-xs-12.col-md-7.col-lg-5.offset-lg-2
    %p
      We've partnered up with Jack Schneider, an assistant professor at Holy Cross and
      the Director of Research with the Massachusetts Consortium for Innovative Education Assessment
      to build a text-messaging service that will allow The Puzzle School (and other schools) to
      collect feedback from students, parents, and teachers throughout the year on a wide-ranging
      set of questions about their experiences with the school.
    %p
      We believe this will help The Puzzle School (and other schools) more effectively listen to
      everyone involved in the school, helping to ensure that the loudest voices are not the only
      opinions considered. We hope the EdContext tool can help foster a more supportive, communicative,
      and involved community by collecting feedback from everyone in the community and making that
      feedback, aggregated to protect privacy, available for everyone else to see and act on.

      The primary goal of ThoughtfulRecommendations is to provide students with more visibility
      into the interests, hobbies, and passions of the teachers at The Puzzle School and other
      adult mentors in the community. The website makes it easy for someone to create a profile
      and list out everything they've discovered in the world that they really appreciate, that
      they would recommend to just about anyone. When you list something you also provide
      a "thoughtful recommendation", so there's a description of why you would recommend it.
    %p
      This allows students to discover fascinating resources and experiences that their teachers
      and other adults in their life really appreciate. It also allows students to get a more
      intimate idea of who the adults in their life are and how complex their interests and lives
      may be. They may even discover that they share some interests and then the student can
      explore the recommendations or even connect with the teacher around that interest.
    %p
      Students could also create profiles for themselves, building up a list of high quality
      resources along with thoughtful recommendations about each one. Teachers, admissions officers,
      and future employers could use this information to learn more about the student.

        We meet with a small group of high school students on a weekly basis to

        experience might look like.

        Topics range from the ideal class to how you can better support discussions
        of controversial topics to what the ideal schedule might look like
        to how you might deal with discipline in a school.

        We have been running a weekly program at the Moses Youth Center in
        Cambridge. The program has ranged from coding
        to more active engineering challenges.
      %p
        Many of the students at the youth center are interested in athletics
        so we're hoping to explore program designs that support that passion
        in the near future.

      %h5 The Art of Thinking
      %p
        Students will explore different frameworks for thinking (e.g. Design Thinking,
        Computational Thinking, First-Principle Thinking) and
        will develop their skills for observation through artistic exercises,
        philosophic discussions, and problem solving challenges.
      %p
        Students will use these skills to reframe challenges and goals in their
        own lives. They will practice observing from different perspectives,
        developing their ability to empathize more effectively, and question
        their own assumptions.
      %p
        Lastly we'll explore the way these processes and techniques have
        been used through-out history and continue to be used across all adult
        professional activities. Students will be supported toward becoming philosophers
        of their own lives and interests.

        The Puzzle School is collaborating with David Ng, the founder of

        = link_to('online resource', 'https://jaredcosulich.github.io/drawing_code/index.html', target: '_blank')
        designed to support an exploration of artistic observation and computational thinking.
        Essentially students will learn how to teach a computer to draw and design games.
      %p
        Through a series of challenges students will develop their ability to observe their physical world
        and translate that into code so that a computer can draw it. From there students
        will be able to animate their drawing and make them interactive (games).
      %p
        The eventual goal is to support students toward projects of their own design that can then
        be shared with friends and family.

        = "#{link_to('Ideo', '', target: '_blank')}.".html_safe
        Drawing on her experiences at IDEO Ela has created the

        a simplified
        framework for engaging in Design Thinking.
      %p
        We are working with Ela to design programs that leverage the Innovator's Compass and Design Thinking
        toward problems that are personally important to students. This may range from choosing a college to
        a fight with a significant other or family member. In each situation student will be asked to
        observe their situation, brainstorm on what matters most, think through possible future,
        think through experiments they could try to achieve their goal, and then repeat.

      %h5 Forge Your Unique Path
      %p
        We are developing a program in collaboration with a local youth center
        to help students think about their interests, their strengths, their future, and
        problems in the world they want to solve.
      %p
        We are currently exploring two areas of focus. The first, more general area, is
        working with students one-on-one, interviewing them about their interests and brainstorming
        other areas of interest before exploring different ways to pursue those interests.
      %p
        The second area will focus on students who have decided that their only interest is sports;
        that playing professional sports is their only path toward a successful adult life.
      %p
        With both groups the goal will be to help students think through
        their future and various options. We aren't trying to explicitly change their mind or discourage
        any path, simply to brainstorm on how to best pursue and potentially expand their goals.
