      People sometimes mistake The Puzzle School for an online learning effort or
      for a school where the curriculum would be delivered online.
    %p
      In reality The Puzzle School seeks to be a physical school focused on a problem-solving
      process that can help foster a healthy community where students have
      greater ownership over their environment and education; where they have time
      to explore their interests and engage in a wide range of studies and projects.
    %p
      %b Technology will play a role in supporting this vision, but it is far from the only concern.
      High quality relationships between students, teachers, and parents,
      deeper exploration of student interests, and an iterative approach to learning are
      all more important than the technology listed below, but all can also be benefited
      by technology used in a thoughtful manner.

      The following websites have been developed to help with infrastructural challenges
      at The Puzzle School, including better communication between students, teachers,
      and parents as well as better ways of connecting with the community and exploring
      student interests.

      We've partnered up with Jack Schneider, an assistant professor at Holy Cross and
      the Director of Research with the Massachusetts Consortium for Innovative Education Assessment
      to build a text-messaging service that will allow The Puzzle School (and other schools) to
      collect feedback from students, parents, and teachers throughout the year on a wide-ranging
      set of questions about their experiences with the school.
    %p
      We believe this will help The Puzzle School (and other schools) more effectively listen to
      everyone involved in the school, helping to ensure that the loudest voices are not the only
      opinions considered. We hope the EdContext tool can help foster a more supportive, communicative,
      and involved community by collecting feedback from everyone in the community and making that
      feedback, aggregated to protect privacy, available for everyone else to see and act on.

      The primary goal of ThoughtfulRecommendations is to provide students with more visibility
      into the interests, hobbies, and passions of the teachers at The Puzzle School and other
      adult mentors in the community. The website makes it easy for someone to create a profile
      and list out everything they've discovered in the world that they really appreciate, that
      they would recommend to just about anyone. When you list something you also provide
      a "thoughtful recommendation", so there's a description of why you would recommend it.
    %p
      This allows students to discover fascinating resources and experiences that their teachers
      and other adults in their life really appreciate. It also allows students to get a more
      intimate idea of who the adults in their life are and how complex their interests and lives
      may be. They may even discover that they share some interests and then the student can
      explore the recommendations or even connect with the teacher around that interest.
    %p
      Students could also create profiles for themselves, building up a list of high quality
      resources along with thoughtful recommendations about each one. Teachers, admissions officers,
      and future employers could use this information to learn more about the student.
