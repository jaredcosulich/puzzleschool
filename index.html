        <h3>What is The Puzzle School?</h3>

        <p>
            The Puzzle School is working to master the art of puzzles to more effectively
            help students (young and old) learn. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Puzzles have long been recognized as one of the most intrinsically
            motivating activities. Most puzzles (think jigsaw, Sudoko, etc) have no rewards,
            and no badges, but people will work on them for hours on end, enjoying the challenge and the progress they make.
        </p>
        <p>
            We believe that the intrinsic motivations inherent to puzzles can a very powerful
            tool in education. We believe that you can remove grades and tests and requirements and
            students will engage with learning more than ever when that learning is presented in the form
            of a puzzle.
        </p>
        <p>
            At the end of the day most of what we do professionally is a puzzle. Artists, engineers, politicians, entrepreneurs, 
            musicians, lawyers, doctors, and thousands of other professions use the same skills 
            (pattern matching, learning from failure, creativity, etc) that are used to solve puzzles. As we seek to give
            our students the skills required to thrive in a rapidly changing world, we think puzzles present a fantastic foundation.
        </p>
        <p>
            Some day we hope to open a brick and mortar "Puzzle School" where students can come together and work together to
            solve puzzles, explore, build, write, create, etc. We think it will be a school that students will truly enjoy and will
            leave with a love of learning and a desire to solve the great puzzles the world has to offer.
        </p>
        <p>
            For now, though, we're focused on building the puzzles that will be the foundation for The Puzzle School, and we're
            going to make them available to as many people as we can.

        <h3>Labs</h3>
        <p>Here are some puzzles we are working on.</p>
          
        <h4>Programming</h4>
        <p><a href='http://peanutty.org'>Peanutty!</a></p>
        <p>Peanutty! is an experiment in teaching people how to code.</p>
        <p>People can solve physics-based puzzles sort of like Angry Birds, while watching their actions create code.</p>
        <p>Once people realize that their actions are creating code they can start to tweak the code and see what happens.</p>
        <p>Small tweaks lead to larger and larger tweaks until they are capable of designing their own Peanutty levels.</p>
        <p>
            Unfortunately Peanutty! is still a little too hard for most people to engage with for long enough to 
            truly learn how to code, but we think it has the potential to become a great puzzle-like environment for learning to program.
        </p>
        
        <br/>
        
        <h4>Foreign Languages</h4>
        <p><a href='italian_scramble.html'>Italian Scramble</a></p>
        <p>Italian Scramble is a simple puzzle meant to help people learn Italian.</p>
        <p>You're presented with an Italian word and need to unscramble the letters to form a correct translation in English</p>
        <p>It's a very rudimentary puzzle, but far more engaging than flash cards.</p>
