        <h3>What is The Puzzle School?</h3>

        <p>
            The Puzzle School is working to master the art of puzzles to more effectively
            help students (young and old) learn. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Puzzles have long been recognized as one of the most intrinsically
            motivating activities. Most puzzles (think jigsaw, Sudoko, etc) have no rewards,
            and no badges, but we will work on them for hours on end, enjoying the challenge and the progress
            we make.
        </p>
        <p>
            We believe that the intrinsic motivations inherent to puzzles can a very powerful
            tool in education. We believe that you can remove grades and tests and requirements and
            students will engage with learning more than ever when that learning is presented in the form
            of a puzzle.
        </p>
        <p>
            We aren't the first to use puzzles to engage learning. Many educational philosophies such as Montessori
            have long leveraged puzzles to educate students in a way that gets them excited about learning. We're just
            hoping to draw more attention to the medium and make educational puzzles more accessible to a larger audience
            through the Internet.

        <h3>Labs</h3>
        <p>Here are some puzzles we are working on.</p>
          
        <h4>Programming</h4>
        <p><a href='http://peanutty.org'>Peanutty!</a></p>
        <p>Peanutty! is an experiment in teaching people how to code.</p>
        <p>People can solve physics-based puzzles sort of like Angry Birds, while watching their actions create code.</p>
        <p>Once people realize that their actions are creating code they can start to tweak the code and see what happens.</p>
        <p>Small tweaks lead to larger and larger tweaks until they are capable of designing their own Peanutty levels.</p>
        
        <br/>
        
        <h4>Foreign Languages</h4>
        <p><a href='italian_scramble.html'>Italian Scramble</a></p>
        <p>Italian Scramble is a simple puzzle meant to help people learn Italian.</p>
        <p>You're presented with an Italian word and need to unscramble the letters to form a correct translation in English</p>
        <p>It's a very rudimentary puzzle, but far more engaging than flash cards.</p>
