        <h2>For Those Who Crave Challenge</h2>
        <p>The Puzzle School is focused on encouraging a specific process:</p>
        <p><b><i>
            The process of figuring something out (puzzling it out), of developing and testing hypotheses, 
            learning from failures and successes, iterating and persisting closer and closer toward a solution.
        </b></i></p>
        <p>
            Our educational puzzles are built to be fun and engaging purely because they present challenges 
            that you can figure out. There are no badges, no high scores, just a sense of accomplishment and 
            progress as you figure out increasingly complex challenges.

        <h2>Collaboration</h2>
        <p>Our primary goal at this point is to prove or disprove the effectiveness of puzzles as a learning strategy.</p>
        <p>
            If you are a teacher who would like to experiment with these ideas in your classroom please
            contact us. We'd love to work with you.
        </p>
        <p>
            In fact, regardless of who you are, if these ideas seem promising and you'd like to help or try them out,
            please contact us. We're very open with our work and are interested in collaborating with anyone we can,
            within the constraints of our very limited resources.

        <h2>Our Mission</h2>
        <p>
            The Puzzle School was started with the mission of creating educational environments that will inspire a greater love
            of learning. We strongly believe that learning is something people truly love to do when it is presented
            in a way that gives the learner a sense of progress toward their learning goals.
        </p>
        <p>
            We focus on puzzles as they provide one of the most effective ways of creating a learning environment
            that is interactive, giving students an immediate sense of progress as they try to "figure out" the material
            they are learning.
        </p>
        <p>
            The methods we use at The Puzzle School mimic the learning environments that children thrive in while 
            learning how to walk and talk. This model can best be summed up as hypothesis and error driven learning, 
            where students develop a hypothesis toward solving a problem and are able to test that hypothesis using feedback loops, 
            learning from a success or failure as they move closer to a solution.
        </p>
        <p>
            This model has been used successfully in thousands of schools around the world, most notably Montessori Schools.
            We simply want to highlight this method and make it so that all students have access to environments where 
            they can learn in this way. We believe this will encourage a love of learning in all students.
