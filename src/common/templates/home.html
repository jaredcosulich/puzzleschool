            The goal of The Puzzle School is to create simple and effective, online and offline educational puzzles that students
            enjoy using because they enjoy the challenges the puzzles offer and the progress they are making in their own learning.
        </p>

        <p>
            Puzzles have long been recognized as one of the most intrinsically motivating activities. 
            Most puzzles (think jigsaw, Sudoko, etc) have no rewards and no badges, but people will 
            work on them for hours on end, enjoying the challenge and the progress they make.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            With many puzzles reaching the end goal is not even the most important part. The focus is
            on the process. You don't do a jigsaw puzzle so that you can see the picture, you do it because
            you enjoy the challenge.
        </p>

        <p>
            I believe that the intrinsic motivations inherent to puzzles can be a very powerful tool 
            in education. I believe that you can remove grades and tests and requirements and students 
            will engage with learning more than ever when that learning is presented in a form that:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Strikes the balance between too easy and too challenging.<br/>
                <small>You don't feel bored or overwhelmed by the challenges.</small>
            </li>
            <li>
                Provides unambiguous feedback.<br/>
                <small>You never have to venture too far without a sense of whether you're headed in the right direction.</small>
            </li>
            <li>
                Has a clear goal.<br/>
                <small>You don't need anyone to confirm for you whether you've reached the goal or not.</small>
            </li>   
        </ul>         
        <!--
        <ul>
            <li>
                Has an obvious purpose<br/>
                <small>There must be some apparent end goal, even if that is simply solving the puzzle.</small>
            </li>
            <li>
                Is highly accessible<br/>
                <small>It can be done at your own pace when ever and where ever you are.</small>
            </li>
            <li>
                Allows for autonomy<br/>
                <small>There are many paths leading to many 'correct' answers.</small>
            </li>
            <li>
                Requires pattern matching and creativity<br/>
                <small>Success requires more than memorization of facts, rote repetition, or obediently following instructions.</small>
            </li>
            <li>
                Facilitates discovery<br/>
                <small>Occasionally you stumble in to a solution and it blows your mind :)</small>
            </li>
            <li>
                Encourages learning from failure and iterating on hypotheses<br/>
                <small>
                    You aren't told what to do. 
                    You have to figure it out on your own through experimentation informed by the patterns you discover.
                </small>
            </li>
            <li>
                Provides frequent intrinsic feedback, leading to a sense of progress<br/>
                <small>The puzzle itself provides immediate feedback about whether you are going in the right direction or not.</small>
            </li>

            This is now I define an excellent puzzle. It's also the definition of "<a href='' target='_blank'>Flow</a>", a mental state
            where the person is fully immersed in an activity, providing a sense of energized focus, full involvement, and enjoyment of
            the process. Essentially it's the feeling of challenge, focus, engagement, and enjoyment that people feel when
            they really get in to a puzzle, be it a jigsaw puzzle, Sudoko, Angry Birds, Tetris, etc.
        </p>

        <p>
            I don't see puzzles as just an app on your phone or a board game on the floor. I think the 
            best puzzles are when people try to explore and create. Building a product, writing a novel, 
            creating a piece of music, investigating history, and many more open ended activities represent 
            some of the best puzzles possible. These are the activities, in addition to more traditional 
            puzzles you might find as an app on your smart phone, that I hope to have students engaging in on a daily basis.
        </p>

            At the end of the day most of what we do professionally is a puzzle. Artists, engineers, politicians, 
            entrepreneurs, musicians, lawyers, doctors, and thousands of other professions use the same skills 
            (creativity, pattern matching, developing strategies, learning from failure, iterating, etc) that are 
            used to solve puzzles. As we seek to give students the skills required to thrive in a rapidly changing 
            world, I think puzzles are a fantastic foundation.
        </p>
        <p>
            Some day I hope to open a brick and mortar "Puzzle School" where students can come together and work 
            together to solve puzzles, explore, build, write, create, etc. I think it will be a school that students 
            will truly enjoy and will leave with a love of learning and a desire to solve the great puzzles the world 
            has to offer (building companies, curing diseases, developing new forms of energy, exploring the unknown, 
            writing great novels, creating amazing art, etc, etc).
        </p>
        <p>
            For now, though, I'm focused on building and discovering the puzzles that will be the foundation for 
            The Puzzle School, and I'm going to make them available to as many people as I can.
            Check out the puzzles I'm working on in <a href='/labs'>the labs</a>.
