        <h2>The Labs</h2>
        <p>
            Although our eventual goal is to start a K-12 school that leverages puzzles (physical, virtual, 
            and more open-ended like writing a story or starting a business) in order to make learning more fun, 
            engaging, and rigorous, right now we're focused on building products that teach various subjects that 
            can be made available to the public.

        <h2>Our Mission</h2>
        <p>
            The Puzzle School was started with the mission of creating educational environments that will inspire a greater love
            of learning. We strongly believe that learning is something people truly love to do when it is presented
            in a way that gives the learner a sense of progress toward their learning goals.
        </p>
        <p>
            We focus on puzzles as they have provide one of the most effective ways of creating a learning environment
            that is interactive, giving students an immediate sense of progress as they try to "figure out" the material
            they are learning.
        </p>
        <p>
            The methods we use at The Puzzle School mimic the learning environments that children thrive in while 
            learning how to walk and talk. This model can best be summed up as hypothesis and error driven learning, 
            where students develop a hypothesis toward solving a problem and are able to test that hypothesis, learning 
            from a success or failure as they move closer to a solution.
        </p>
        <p>
            This model has been used successfully in thousands of schools around the world, most notably Montessori Schools.
            We simply want to highlight this method and make it so that all students have access to environments where 
            they can learn in this way. We believe this will encourage a love of learning in all students.
