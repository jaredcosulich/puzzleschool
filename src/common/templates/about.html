        <h2>About The Puzzle School</h2>
        <p>
            The goal of The Puzzle School is to support self-directed learning through high quality resources and educational environments.
        </p> 
        <p>
            To solve puzzles you must create theories or hypotheses about what will work and then test those hypotheses, 
            learning from both successes and failures to form better hypotheses. I build educational puzzles to
            encourage this process. I believe that this process if not just an excellent way to approach learning,
            but is also a process that people truly enjoy.
        </p>    
        <p>
            I believe that people truly crave challenge. That they want to learn when they feel in control of that learning,
            when they feel like they are trying to satisfy their curiosity or solve a challenge that is within their reach.
        </p>
        <p>    
            Hopefully these resources help deliver such an experience. 
            I hope that people of all ages will enjoy and learn from these puzzles.
        </p>

        <h2>A Physical Puzzle School</h2>
        <p>
          One day I hope to start a school that provides students with greater respect and responsibility in their own
          education, giving them greater control over their own school through the principles of a democratic school.
          The message to students would be:
          
          <blockquote>
              Figuring out your life is the most challenging puzzle you'll face and you're the only one who can do it.
              <br/> 
              We're here to help in any way we can, but we're not going to do it for you. 
              <br/> 
              We can offer advice, but it's up to you to decide whether to follow it.
              <br/> 
              Life doesn't offer many simple decisions and we're here to support and respect you as you try to figure it all out.
          </blockquote>
