        <h2>About The Puzzle School</h2>
        <p>The goal of The Puzzle School is to foster a love of learning in all people.</p> 
        <p>
            To solve puzzles you must create theories or hypotheses about what will work and then test those hypotheses, 
            learning from both successes and failures to form better hypotheses. We build our educational puzzles to
            encourage this process. We believe that this process if not just an excellent way to approach learning,
            but is also a process that people truly enjoy.
        </p>    
        <p>
            We believe that people truly crave challenge. That they want to learn when they feel in control of that learning,
            when they feel like they are trying to satisfy their curiosity or solve a challenge that is within their reach.
        </p>
        <p>    
            Our goal is to deliver such an experience. We hope that people of all ages will enjoy the challenges 
            they find in what we've built.
