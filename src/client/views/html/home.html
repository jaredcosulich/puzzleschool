        Our goal is to master the art of puzzles to more effectively help students (young and old) learn.
    </p>

    <p>
        Puzzles have long been recognized as one of the most intrinsically motivating activities. 
        Most puzzles (think jigsaw, Sudoko, etc) have no rewards and no badges, but people will 
        work on them for hours on end, enjoying the challenge and the progress they make.
    </p>

    <p>
        We believe that the intrinsic motivations inherent to puzzles can be a very powerful tool 
        in education. We believe that you can remove grades and tests and requirements and students 
        will engage with learning more than ever when that learning is presented in a form that:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Allows for autonomy</li>
        <li>Facilitates discovery</li>
        <li>Requires pattern matching and creativity</li>
        <li>Encourages learning from failure and iterating on hypotheses</li>
        <li>Provides frequent intrinsic feedback, leading to a sense of progress</li>
        <li>Has an obvious purpose</li>
    </ul>
    <p> 
        This is how we define a puzzle.
    </p>

    <p>
        We don't see puzzles as just an app on your phone or a board game on the floor. We think the 
        best puzzles are when people try to explore and create. Building a product, writing a novel, 
        creating a piece of music, investigating history, and many more open ended activities represent 
        some of the best puzzles possible. These are the activities, in addition to more traditional 
        puzzles you might find as an app on your smart phone, that we hope to have students engaging in on a daily basis.
    </p>
    <p>
        At the end of the day most of what we do professionally is a puzzle. Artists, engineers, politicians, 
        entrepreneurs, musicians, lawyers, doctors, and thousands of other professions use the same skills 
        (creativity, pattern matching, developing strategies, learning from failure, iterating, etc) that are 
        used to solve puzzles. As we seek to give students the skills required to thrive in a rapidly changing 
        world, we think puzzles are a fantastic foundation.
    </p>
    <p>
        Some day we hope to open a brick and mortar "Puzzle School" where students can come together and work 
        together to solve puzzles, explore, build, write, create, etc. We think it will be a school that students 
        will truly enjoy and will leave with a love of learning and a desire to solve the great puzzles the world 
        has to offer (building companies, curing diseases, developing new forms of energy, exploring the unknown, 
        writing great novels, creating amazing art, etc, etc).
    </p>

        For now, though, we're focused on building and discovering the puzzles that will be the foundation for 
        The Puzzle School, and we're going to make them available to as many people as we can.
