            My name is Jared Cosulich. I have a daughter, Abby, who was born Oct. 16, 2011.

            I'm building The Puzzle School because I want her to come away from her education with
            a love of learning. I don't want her to leave school, like so many people do, thinking
            that learning is something we must force ourselves to do no matter how boring or painful it might be. 
        </p>
        <p>
            I personally didn't start to really enjoy the learning process until after I graduated from college.
            I realized that if I treated my learning like a puzzle and attempted to figure out
            the strategies that made it easier to learn and master, then I enjoyed the process a great deal more and
            spent more time learning.
        </p>
        <p>
            Eventually I realized that not only was I enjoying the process more, but, compared to other learning strategies,
            I was actually feeling energized rather than being exhausted by my efforts. No longer was learning about memorization
            or repetitive actions. Now it was about solving a puzzle, and solving a puzzle was much more interesting than just
            memorizing facts.
        </p>
        <p>
            I also realized that the progress I made was much more engaging and motivating because it came from hypotheses I had developed
            on my own. Rather than having an instructor tell me how to do something and then try to repeat it, I was the one figuring
            out what to do. I found the process to be very satisfying.
        </p>

            Millions of people enjoy solving puzzles every day. Jigsaw puzzles have been around for more than 200 years, crossword 
            puzzles more than 100 years, and more recently puzzles like Tetris, Sudoku, and Angry Birds have captivated millions of people.
        </p>
        <p>
            My goal is to make learning feel more like these classic activities that we have enjoyed for centuries. I want learning to be 
            a process of discovery. I want to create environments that encourage students to figure out solutions 
            through pattern matching, creativity, iterating, and lots of missteps. To me puzzles are the embodiment of all of this and
            I think that's why we enjoy them so much. I don't think there's any reason that all of education can't look and feel more
            like a puzzle.
